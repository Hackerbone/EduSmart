## Problems It Solves
In this pandemic situation E-learning is the new trend . from past year students are stuck at their homes and attended numerous online classes.
But  online classes are monotonous and concepts taught are not retained by our minds.
Situation becomes worse when a subject is mostly based on practicals , because actual feel / visualisation is most important in such subjects like Aerospace, Biology and many more.
With this application we focus to solve this problem. It utilizes the 3d/ virtual reality to give life/real life simulation or feel of various model and make the learning process more impactful and interesting.With a interactive live feature students can ask to teacher their doubt instantly and also can discuss among themselves.
